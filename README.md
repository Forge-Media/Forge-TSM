Welcome to ForgeTSM, a Teamspeak 3 channel creator web-app based on PHP & ts3admin.class, developed using Cloud9 & deployable to Heroku. We intend to either use AngularJS or Bootstrap for the frontend, however thats all in the future right now we are focused on the backend.

By utilising  ts3admin.class the ForgeCP panel requires no server side application or integration and communicates directly with a TS3 server via Server Query.
